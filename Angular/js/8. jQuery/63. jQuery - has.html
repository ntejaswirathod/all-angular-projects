		<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing.</p>

		<p>It is a long established fact that a reader <span>will be distracted</span> by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout.</p>

		<p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.</p>

		<p>It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from <span>45 BC</span>, making it over 2000 years old.</p>

		<p>If you are going to use a passage of <span>Lorem Ipsum</span>, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text.</p>

		<p>The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</p>

		<p>Various versions have over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose.</p>

		<p>There are many variations of passages of <span>Lorem Ipsum available</span>, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable.</p>

		<p>If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text.</p>

		<p>All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet.</p>

				//It selects the <p> tags that have a child called <span>
