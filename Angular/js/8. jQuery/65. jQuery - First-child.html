			<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing.</p>

			<p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout.</p>

			<p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.</p>

		</div>

		<div id="div2">

			<p>It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.</p>

			<p>If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text.</p>

			<p>The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</p>

		</div>


		<div id="div3">

			<p>Various versions have over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose.</p>

			<p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable.</p>

			<p>If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text.</p>

			<p>All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet.</p>
